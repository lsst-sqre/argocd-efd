This means that when you query the EFD via Chronograf or the EFD client the timestamps for the InfluxDB time column are returned in UTC. So you can either use the function now() in your InfluxQL queries safely, or manipualte time using Flux without worring about the time shift between TAI and UTC. The column private_sndStamp still has the timestamps in TAI and can be used if you need to work with the TAI scale.</p>",
